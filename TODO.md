#To Do List


1.  Build classifier according to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790621002597
    _  Find alternative image based engagement dataset to train focus classifier
    _  Train emotion detection classifier on FER dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013
    _  Evaluate on datasets such as CK+ and DaISEE

2.  Build classifier according to https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume14No3/Paper_71-Convolutional_Neural_Network_Model.pdf
    _  Figure out how to extract features using OpenFace library and perform feature selection using either PCA or SVD
    _  Try to get comparable performance as in paper and evaluate performance on other video based engagement datasets like CK+
