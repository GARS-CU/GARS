#To Do List


-Build classifier according to https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045790621002597
  -Find alternative image based engagement dataset to train focus classifier
  -Train emotion detection classifier on FER dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013
  -Evaluate on datasets such as CK+ and DaISEE

-Build classifier according to https://thesai.org/Downloads/Volume14No3/Paper_71-Convolutional_Neural_Network_Model.pdf
 -Figure out how to extract features using OpenFace library and perform feature selection using either PCA or SVD
 -Try to get comparable performance as in paper and evaluate performance on other video based engagement datasets like CK+
